## Task Manager App

This Task Manager application was built using a vibe coding (AI-assisted) technique with tools like Bolt and Qoder to quickly develop and iterate on functionality. Users can sign up and log in, create and manage tasks with titles, descriptions, priorities, and due dates, and update task status. Users can use checkboxes to select numerous tasks and conduct bulk actions such as deleting or completing them. The interface is responsive and user-friendly, and it offers a sleek light/dark theme to improve usage.
The application is intended to help users manage their everyday duties more efficiently by providing a clean, modern, and user-friendly layout.
